# BPE_Tokenizer
A tokenizer that processes a text file and shows tokens with their token IDs using tiktoken BPE.

The main idea in tokenizer which uses BPE algorithm is to convert text tokens into an integer representation.

The goal of the BPE tokenization algorithm is to build a vocabulary of commonly occurring subwords.

['h', 'i', 'g', 'h', '</w>']
['h', 'i', 'g', 'h', 'e', 'r', '</w>']
['h', 'i', 'g', 'h', 'e', 's', 't', '</w>']
